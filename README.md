# Motivation/Situation
I am an avid fan of both football and the game FIFA. I have been playing FIFA for the past 10 years or so and had always been fascinated with the developments (however few they maybe) taking place in the game. This time around, I decided to leverage the dataset used in the game to create a practical model which is a perfect intersection of my favorite game FIFA and my desired field of work that is Analytics.

# Task
The objective of this project is to build a player clustering model based on their potential in positions like goalkeeping, defense, midfield and attack. The players thus identified can be used by the clubs for scouting purpose and as potential targets during the summer and winter transfer window.

# Action
1. Collecting Data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering
4. Filling Missing Data
5. Algorithm Deployment: K-Means Clustering

# Result 
Able to classify attacking players into 5 different categories with each cluster denoting the rating.

# Advantage of the project- 
1.	It can help the sports franchises (clubs in this case) to get an estimate of the playerâ€™s worth in transfer windows.
2.	It can help in the identification of early rising talents.
3.	Since, it is based on the real-life dataset of FIFA with applicability in football so it can be applied in National Basketball Association (NBA), National Football League (NFL), and National Hockey League (NHL) among others using the datasets of games like NBA, NFL and NHL respectively.

# Dataset
FIFA 22 players dataset obtained from Kaggle.
