# FIFA Project
Player Clustering Model

# Motivation/Situation
I am an avid fan of both football and the video game FIFA. I have been playing FIFA for quite a while now and had always been fascinated with the developments (however few they maybe) taking place in the game. This time around, I decided to leverage the dataset used in the game to create a practical Machine Learning Model which is a perfect intersection between my favorite game FIFA and my desired field of work, Analytics.

# Task
The objective of this project is to build a player clustering model based on their potential in various positions like goalkeeping, defense, midfield and attack. The players thus identified can be used by the clubs for scouting purpose and as potential targets during the summer and winter transfer window.

# Action
1. Collecting Data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering
4. Filling Missing Data
5. Algorithm Deployment: K-Means Clustering

# Result 
Classified attacking players into 5 different categories with each cluster denoting their attacking rating.

# Advantage of the project
1.	It can help the sports franchises (football clubs in this case) to get an estimate of the playerâ€™s worth in transfer window.
2.	It can help in the identification of early rising talents.
3.	Since, it is based on the real-life dataset of FIFA with applicability in football so, it can be applied in National Basketball Association (NBA), National Football League (NFL), and National Hockey League (NHL) among others using the datasets of video games like NBA, NFL and NHL respectively.

Note: The aforementioned advantages are indicative of my own viewpoint and are not exhaustive. I would be glad to hear your opinion on this! 

# Dataset
FIFA 22 players dataset obtained from Kaggle.

Thank you for reading.
